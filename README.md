# Fun on Keyboard

Simple game to show something more fun than lock screen when my baby is playing
with the keyboard.

```
$ ./main.py --help

pygame 1.9.4
Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
usage: main.py [-h] [--window] [--hide-key]

On keypress: slightly change the color of the screen and play a sound.
When no action is taking place, fade out colors.

All of this done in an animated manner.

Quits on (ALT or CTRL) + (Q or F4)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --window    run on window mode instead of fullscreen
  --hide-key  print which keys are being pressed
```
